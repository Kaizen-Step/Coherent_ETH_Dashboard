### Why Ethereum Shanghai Update (Shapella) Is Important ###  
Ethereum‚Äôs Shanghai upgrade, also commonly referred to as Shapella (we‚Äôll explain why below), took place on April 12th.
It was a major upgrade following Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake (a.k.a The Merge), and it introduced a major mechanic change.
The upgrade consists of a few Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), although most of the focus is on one particular.
With that in mind, let‚Äôs take a closer look and understand why the Shanghai upgrade is so important. The Shanghai Upgrade transition is the network's next upgrade of the Ethereum mainnet. It primarily aims to transition to proof of stake, consequently allowing validators to finally withdraw their staked ETH both partially and fully.
This is a major improvement and will further incentivize the crypto community to shift towards ETH accelerating network participation. As of yet, the pre Shanghai testnet allows for both complete and partial validations to be withdrawn.
The upgrade also introduces Layer 2 fee reductions with the implementation of proto-danksharding aiding in the network's overall scalability and sustainability while also reducing gas fees. Moreover, the upgrade will also introduce EOF, separating code and data, which is significantly helpful for code validation.    
The release date of the Shanghai Upgrade is expected to be around March and April.However, there's no confirmation and developers agreed that this date may be pushed forward to as late as September 2023, especially with EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) already being delayed to a March 2023 update.

### What is EIP-4895 in the Shanghai Upgrade? ###
While it‚Äôs currently running on PoS, Ethereum was using the proof-of-work consensus algorithm well before The Merge took place, But the plans to transition were in play for many years when developers created the so-called Beacon Chain.
The Beacon Chain was (and still is) secured by PoS. To maintain its integrity, allow it to function as intended, and carry out transactions and smart contracts, it needed validators ‚Äì just like any other PoS-based blockchains where miners do not exist.
Therefore, those who wanted to partake in the future of the so-called Ethereum 2.0 were able to stake 32 ETH to secure the Beacon chain. The ETH was staked in the Beacon Depositor contract. Validators would then earn interest on their ETH ‚Äì a reward for securing the network during this development stage.
The only catch? Well, they weren‚Äôt allowed to unstake their 32 ETH until a later, undetermined date. It‚Äôs taken years for the team to successfully deliver The Merge, and now, the Shanghai upgrade, through EIP-4895, finally allowed validators to unlock their ETH.
This guide is not intended as a technical walkthrough, so if you want to learn more about how the mechanic will become possible, please take a look at the official website page for EIP-4895.
In essence, the goal was to:
Introduce a system-level ‚Äúoperation‚Äù to support validator withdrawals that are ‚Äúpushed‚Äù from the beacon chain to the EVM. These operations create unconditional balance increases to the specified recipients.
The Beacon depositor contract, as mentioned above, contained about 18 million ETH, which accounted for roughly 15% of the total circulating supply.
Validators are now free to withdraw, albeit with some considerations, their stake and do whatever they decide with it ‚Äì it becomes entirely liquid. That made this particular EIP very important.[[2]](https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-shapella-upgrade-everything-you-need-to-know/)

## Methodology ##  

The Russia-Ukraine war has had several impacts on the global economy. One of the most significant impacts is the disruption of energy supplies. Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian gas exports to Europe, and the conflict has raised concerns about the security and reliability of energy supplies to the region. We attempted to track the impact of the Russian invasion (Ukraine-Russia War), which took place on February 24, 2022, on several facets of the world economy in this dashboard. We were able to compare the the stock market before and after the invasion as well as cryptocurrency, real estate prices, agricultural prices, and inflation. Unfortunately, due to incomplete and outdated information regarding Russia's economy after the war(which might be a policy for war situations), the majority of studies concentrated on European countries as a region near to the war and the United States as a country that was influenced by the war but was not directly participating in it. 
We tooke two-year spans from the year before and the year following the war for the majority of the charts. The time frame was increased in certain instances to five years in order to better comprehend the perspective. Eight different databases were used to create in-depth analyses for each section of this dashboard. Below is a list of the databases and the parts they were used in:


* [Federal Reserve Economic DataBase ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data.htm) (US Inflation, Employment)
* [Euro Stat Economic DataBase ](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/data/database) (Euro Inflation, Unemployment Rate)
* [U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ](https://www.bls.gov/data/) (Employment)
* [Yahoo Finance ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC) (Stock Market , Cryptocurrencies)
* [International Construction Cost Report ](https://www.arcadis.com/en/knowledge-hub/perspectives/global/international-construction-costs) (Construction Costs)
* [International Cost Engineering Council) ](https://www.icoste.org) (Real Estate)
* [World Bank Open Data ](https://data.worldbank.org/) (Real Estate, Agricultral Price)
* [Euro Stat Ukraine War ](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/ukraine) (Ukraine Refugee Granted temporary protection)
